## Overview

**Faah** is a lightweight VS Code extension that listens for errors and plays a sound when they appear.

No more silent failures.
No more unnoticed broken builds.
No more cursed error output.

If your errors get dramatic — **Faah gets louder.**

---

## Features

- Plays a sound (`faah`) when errors are detected
- Lightweight and fast
- Regex-based error detection
- Cooldown system to prevent spam
- Terminal and editor diagnostics source toggles
- Diagnostics severity mode (`Error` or `Error + Warning`)
- Built-in false-positive exclude patterns you can edit
- Status bar indicator with source-aware quick actions
- Fully configurable patterns
- Works smoothly across your coding workflow

---

## Configuration

Use Faah from the status bar.

1. In VS Code, click `Faah Off`, `Faah T`, `Faah E`, or `Faah T+E` in the bottom bar.
2. Choose what you want: turn Faah on/off, select terminal/editor/both, switch error mode, play test sound, or open full settings.

If you prefer Command Palette, run:

`Faah: Show Quick Actions`

---

## Use Case

Faah is perfect when you:

* Run long tasks
* Work with noisy logs
* Switch tabs while working
* Miss subtle error messages
* Want dramatic feedback while coding 😄

---

## Philosophy

Coding is already dramatic.

Faah just makes sure you hear it.
