## Overview

**Faah** is a lightweight VS Code extension that listens for errors and plays a sound when they appear.

No more silent failures.
No more unnoticed broken builds.
No more cursed error output.

If your errors get dramatic — **Faah gets louder.**

---

## Features

- Plays a sound (`faah`) when errors are detected
- Lightweight and fast
- Regex-based error detection
- Cooldown system to prevent spam
- Fully configurable patterns
- Works smoothly across your coding workflow

---

## Configuration

Faah now uses a dedicated visual settings dashboard.

Open Command Palette and run:

`Faah: Open Settings UI`

From the UI, users can control:

- Enable/disable monitoring
- Cooldown in milliseconds
- Volume (`0` to `100`)
- Pattern mode (`override` or `append`)
- Regex patterns list (one per line)
- Save/reset and quick test playback

---

## Use Case

Faah is perfect when you:

* Run long tasks
* Work with noisy logs
* Switch tabs while working
* Miss subtle error messages
* Want dramatic feedback while coding 😄

---

## Philosophy

Coding is already dramatic.

Faah just makes sure you hear it.
